// findResource is a helper function intended for finding a single resource based on certain filtering constraints,

// creations.
// The function expects two callbacks:
//   - A function listing and looking for a single resource, returning its pointer if found. If errors occur or multiple
//     resources match the constraints, it returns an error. If no resource it found, it returns nil.
//   - A function checking the request queue for a matching resource creation and returning information about the
//     request if found. If no request is found, nil is returned. If errors occur, they are returned.
//
// As request queue lookups are rather expensive, we list and filter first. If no resource is found, we check the
// request queue. If a request is found and if it is reported as DONE, we assume a possible race condition:
// When initially listing the resources, the request was possibly not DONE yet. Not it is, so we list and filter again
// to see if the resource was created in the meantime.
